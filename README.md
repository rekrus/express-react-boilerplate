## Express React Boilerplate

It is a Boilerplate starter kit for Javascript application with [Express](https://expressjs.com "ExpressJS") in back-end and [React](https://reactjs.org "ReactJS") (Typescript) in front-end.

Back-end is bootstrapped with `express-generator` and front-end is bootstrapped with `create-react-app` typescript option.

front-end and back-end both uses `ESlint` for JavaScript common syntax errors and `Prettier` for style issues and automatically reformats your code to ensure consistent rules are being followed.


### Getting Started

1. Clone the repo -> `git clone https://github.com/rekrus/express-react-boilerplate`
2. Change directory to project -> `cd express-react-boilerplate`
3. Install server dependencies -> `npm install`
4. Install client dependencies -> `cd client && npm install`
5. Create `.env` file in client -> `cp .env.example .env` (sets react `PORT` to `5000` and `SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK` to `true`)
6. Start client and server with -> `npm run app`

Hureyy, There you go :tada:
